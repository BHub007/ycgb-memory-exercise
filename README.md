# Working Memory Exercise

An interactive brain training tool designed to strengthen working memory and attention - particularly helpful for women experiencing menopause-related cognitive changes.

Created for [YouCanGetBetter](https://youcangetbetter.substack.com) Substack readers.

##  Why This Matters

About 60% of women report memory and concentration difficulties during perimenopause and menopause. While hormonal changes are the root cause, research shows that working memory is trainable - regular practice can help maintain cognitive sharpness during this transition.

This exercise trains your ability to:
- Hold information in short-term memory
- Focus and concentrate under pressure
- Recall specific details accurately
- Map information to spatial positions

##  How It Works

1. **Memorize** - You'll see 5 digits displayed in numbered positions (1-5) for 3 seconds
2. **Recall** - Enter the digits back in a specific pattern across 8 attempts
3. **Challenge** - You'll be tested not just on the sequence, but on remembering which digit was in which position
4. **Improve** - Track your accuracy and practice regularly to build mental stamina

**The pattern tests both sequential recall AND positional memory** - a more challenging workout for your brain than simple digit repetition.

Works on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

##  Tips for Best Results

- **Practice regularly** - Even 5 minutes daily is better than occasional longer sessions
- **Eliminate distractions** - Find a quiet moment to focus fully
- **Don't get discouraged** - The exercise is challenging by design; improvement comes with practice
- **Track your progress** - Notice if your accuracy improves over days/weeks
- **Be patient** - Cognitive training takes time; give it at least 2-3 weeks of regular practice

##  What to Expect

- **First attempts:** Most people score 50-70% accuracy
- **After regular practice:** Many see improvement to 80-90%+ within a few weeks
- **The real benefit:** Not just better scores, but improved focus and mental clarity in daily life

## ⚠️ Important Note

This exercise can help maintain and strengthen working memory, but it's not a medical treatment. If you're experiencing severe cognitive symptoms, persistent confusion, or memory issues that interfere with daily life, please consult with a healthcare provider.

Menopause-related cognitive changes are usually temporary, but ruling out other causes is important.
